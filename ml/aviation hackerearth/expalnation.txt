--------Text file expalining my procedures--------------------
1. Basically as the problem stated we had to predict How severe can an airplane accident be?

2. As it was a Machine Learning problem I prefered to use Python programming language due to 
 vast libraries and community support and Spyder IDE due to its support for Scientific Programming.
 
3. I loaded the training and testing data using pandas library as it is a powerful library for data
processing in Python and analyzed the data for nan values, outliers etc. I got that the data belongs to classification problem.

4. The severity column was our label column or target column need to be predicted for test data.
But it was a categorical column so I encoded it using sklearn library for better model training.

5. Then I seperated features and labels from the training data.

6. After that I applied feature extraction to get the most prominent features to predict the labels.
 I used statsmodel library to do this. I had to add a constant column before applying the feature extraction looping as 
 statsmodel need that. I also used numpy library to remove the unwanted features.
 
7. Then I applied many classification models like SVC, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, 
Decision Tree for model training . All of them provided a good training score but when I applied 
them on the test data all of them performed poorly. This was due to overfitting of the training data.

8. Then I applied bagging classifier on all the models and to the the suprise Decsision Tree classifier
not only provided a good score for training data but for testing data as well.
